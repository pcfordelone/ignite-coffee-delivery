Mini e-commerce application in React to train some concepts such as componetization, React hooks, ContextAPI, LocalStorage, state immutability, among others.

This project was a challenge proposed in the Rocketseat Ignite course. The material offered was just the layout of the screens in Figma. I created improvements for access via mobile and small punctual changes in the layout.a quick start toolbar with pre-made templates.
